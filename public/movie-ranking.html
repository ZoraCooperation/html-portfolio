<h1>The Best Movies According to Rayan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Brother</h3>
<p>
Many films that tackle Black stories prioritize plight, treating their characters as 
inconsequential stand-ins for a thesis on trauma and pain. More successful, powerful 
films devote their narrative effort to how characters move through their environments. 
They afford their subjects agency and identity, rendering them as individuals instead 
of thoughtless symbols of the Black experience. It’s a nuanced distinction, but prioritizing 
character relays a deeper level of understanding and empathy, which Clement Virgo’s “Brother” 
executes poignantly.

<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>
"Barbie," director and co-writer Greta Gerwig’s summer splash, is a dazzling achievement, 
both technically and in tone. It’s a visual feast that succeeds as both a gleeful escape 
and a battle cry. So crammed with impeccable attention to detail is "Barbie” that you 
couldn’t possibly catch it all in a single sitting; you’d have to devote an entire viewing 
just to the accessories, for example. The costume design (led by two-time Oscar winner 
Jacqueline Durran) and production design (led by six-time Oscar nominee Sarah Greenwood) 
are constantly clever and colorful, befitting the ever-evolving icon, and cinematographer 
Rodrigo Prieto (a three-time Oscar nominee) gives everything a glossy gleam. It’s not just 
that Gerwig & Co. have recreated a bunch of Barbies from throughout her decades-long history, 
outfitted them with a variety of clothing and hairstyles, and placed them in pristine dream 
houses. It’s that they’ve brought these figures to life with infectious energy and a knowing wink.

<h3>Klondike</h3>
<p>
Pregnancy makes you pragmatic. Yes, your body is bulging and your hormones are raging and 
anxiety is plaguing you over the great unknown of it all, especially if you’re expecting your 
first child like Oksana Cherkashyna’s Irka is in the Ukrainian drama “Klondike.”
